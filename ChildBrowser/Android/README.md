# ChildBrowser plugin for Phonegap #

The child browser allows you to display external web pages within your PhoneGap application.

A simple use case would be:

- Users can post links, and you don't want your users to exit your app to view the link.

This command creates a popup browser that is shown in front of your app, when the user presses the back button they are simply returned to your app.

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

Using this plugin requires [Android PhoneGap](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-android).

1. To install the plugin, move childbrowser.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html file after phonegap.js.

    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="phonegap.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="childbrowser.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

2. Create a directory within your project called "src/com/phonegap/plugins/childBrowser" and move ChildBrowser.java into it.

3. Add the following activity to your AndroidManifest.xml file.  It should be added inside the &lt;application&gt; tag.

    &lt;activity android:name="com.phonegap.DroidGap" android:label="@string/app_name"&gt;<br/>
      &lt;intent-filter&gt;<br/>
      &lt;/intent-filter&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/activity&gt;


## Using the plugin ##

The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.childBrowser`.  To use, call one of the following, available methods:

<pre>
  /**
   * Display a new browser with the specified URL.
   * 
   * NOTE: If usePhoneGap is set, only trusted PhoneGap URLs should be loaded,
   *       since any PhoneGap API can be called by the loaded HTML page.
   *
   * @param url           The url to load
   * @param usePhoneGap   Load url in PhoneGap webview [optional] - Default: false
   */
   
  showWebPage(url, [usePhoneGap])
</pre>

Sample use:

    window.plugins.childBrowser.showWebPage("http://www.google.com");
