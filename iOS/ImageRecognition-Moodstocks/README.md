# Moodstocks SDK PhoneGap plugin

This is a PhoneGap plugin that uses Moodstocks real-time on-device image recognition SDK. We provide a demo application to help you get started.

So far we only support the iOS platform (tested with PhoneGap v2.3). The Android version is under development.

This plugin is hosted at: [https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-phonegap-demo-app](https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-phonegap-demo-app)

## Real-time on-device image recognition SDK

The Moodstocks SDK provides a scanner for mobile devices. It recognizes both barcodes and images. Scanning operates on the client-side which lets you create nice augmented reality overlays. Also it even works off-line thanks to a built-in, easy-to-use on-device image signatures synchronization.

To get started (for free!) create an account on [Moodstocks Developer Center](https://developers.moodstocks.com/) and follow the instructions.
