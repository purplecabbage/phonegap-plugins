## PhoneGap AudioEncode Plugin ##
by Lyle Pratt
Updated Oct 2012 by Keenan Wyrobek for Cordova 2.1.0

## About this Plugin ##

This plugin lets you easily convert WAV audio into M4A audio. It is useful when using Phonegap's audio capture or media recording functionality. Uploading WAV files on via cellular connections is not advised.		M4A encoded files are		1/4 to 1/10 the size.

## Using the Plugin ##

The plugin creates a global CompressAudio(originalSrc, success, fail, obj) method.
		originalSrc: (required) This is a string path to the local file to encode. This is typically the fullPath property of the entry passed to the success of a fileSystem.root.getFile call
		success: (required) This function is called when the encoding has completed successfully. It will be called in one of two ways.
				if obj is passed into CompressAudio - success(m4ASource, obj)
				if obj is not passed into CompressAudio - success(m4ASource)
		fail: (required) This function is called on encode failure and will be passed a statusCode.
		obj: (optional) this object is passed through to success function.

Example:

		CompressAudio(pathToWavFile, success, fail);

		var success = function(newM4APath) {
			//Do something with your new encoded audio (upload it?)
			console.log(newM4APath);
		}

		var fail = function(statusCode) {
			//Why did it fail?
			console.log(statusCode);
		}
