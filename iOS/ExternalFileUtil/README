PhoneGap iOS ExternalFileUtil Plugin
by: Andrew Trice (atrice@adobe.com)

The PhoneGap iOS ExternalFileUtil Plugin is a native Plugin for PhoneGap/Apache Cordova which provides the ability to open documents in an external program on the iOS device.   A sample use case would be that you want to provide the user the ability to open a file in another program, of their choosing.   For instance, the user wants to open a DRM-protected PDF in Adobe Reader.  Note: the user must already have the appropriate external reader app installed.

The plugin accepts a URL path to the document which you want to open, as well as the UTI (uniform type identifier).  The plugin will then display an "open with" dialog which allows the user to select which file to use for opening the document.

Sample usage for a PDF document:
ExternalFileUtil.openWith( "http://www.tricedesigns.com/temp/log_samsung.pdf", "com.adobe.pdf" );

The PhoneGap native plugin is written in Objective C, with a JavaScript interface to integrate with the client application. 

The "plugin" directory contains all source code for the plugin, separated into 2 separate folders: the JavaScript interface and the native Objective-C code.

The "samples" directory contains a sample application that shows how to open a document with an external viewer using the EternalFilePlugin native plugin.
