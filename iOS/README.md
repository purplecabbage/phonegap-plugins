New iOS plugins should be submitted here.

As existing iPhone/iOS plugins are patched and COMPLETELY abandon the PhoneGap naming convention they will be placed here.

The present https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone should be preserved for use with projects still using PhoneGap 1.4.1 and before.

**Cordova Plugin Upgrade Guide
**

This document is for developers who need to upgrade their Cordova plugins to a newer Cordova version. Starting with Cordova 1.5.0, some classes have been renamed, which will require the plugin to be upgraded. Make sure your project itself has been upgraded using the "Cordova Upgrade Guide" document.
Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.5.0

1. Install Cordova 1.5.0
2. Replace macro occurrences of "PHONEGAP_FRAMEWORK"with"CORDOVA_FRAMEWORK" 
3. Replace import occurrences of "<PhoneGap/" with "<Cordova/"
4. Replace class prefixes of PG with CDV (for example PGPlugin becomes CDVPlugin)
5. Replace occurrences of [self appViewController] with self.viewController.

1.5.0 Plugin Notes

1. The UIViewController returned from the viewController property will be a CDVViewController subclass.
2. The appDelegate method basically returns an (id) now, and is the same as calling [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]. In the past it returned a PhoneGapDelegate class.
3. There is a new commandDelegate property now, which gives access to the CDVCommandDelegate protocol used by the app
4. There is a new header file CDVAvailability.h that defines Cordova versions during compile time - to check for the current version during run-time, call [CDVViewController cordovaVersion]
