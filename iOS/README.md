#Cordova Plugin Upgrade Guide

This document is for developers who need to upgrade their Cordova plugins to a newer Cordova version. Starting with Cordova 1.5.0, some classes have been renamed, which will require the plugin to be upgraded. Make sure your project itself has been upgraded using the "Cordova Upgrade Guide" document.
Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 2.0.0

1. Install Cordova 2.0.0
2. Follow the "Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.9.0" section, if necessary
3. No changes in plugin structure from 1.9.x
4. Change in import header use: in 2.0.0, Cordova projects use the CordovaLib project as a subproject, it now uses the CORDOVA_FRAMEWORK styled import like this:<br>
        
<code>#import  <Cordova/CDV.h></code>

instead of like this:<br>

<code>#import "CDV.h"</code>


So now in 2.0.0, Cordova import headers are unified.
NOTE: The deprecated for 2.0.0 CDVPlugin methods verifyArguments and appViewController have been removed.


##Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.9.0
1. Install Cordova 1.9.0
2. Follow the "Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.8.0" section, if necessary 3. No changes in plugin structure from 1.8.x

##Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.8.0
1. Install Cordova 1.8.0
2. Follow the "Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.7.0" section, if necessary 3. No changes in plugin structure from 1.7.x

##Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.7.0
1. Install Cordova 1.7.0
2. Follow the "Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.6.0" section, if necessary 3. No changes in plugin structure from 1.6.x

##Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.6.x
1. Install Cordova 1.6.x
2. Follow the "Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.5.0" section, if necessary
3. See the 1.6.0 Plugin Notes section for new functionality available to plugins
4. The global "Cordova" (upper-case C) was renamed to "cordova" (lower-case c) to match the cordova-js Android implementation in 1.5.0 that is now common to Android, Blackberry and iOS. Please rename your calls to reflect the new lower-case c, or you can add a shim (which will support older versions) like so:
5. Wrap your plugin JavaScript in a temporary scope (self-executing function) - see "Temporary Scope" or this b. Inside your temporary scope, set a local var to the global PhoneGap/Cordova/cordova object, for the exec
function
var cordovaRef = window.PhoneGap || window.Cordova || window.cordova; // old to new fallbacks
6. Replace any PhoneGap or Cordova or cordova in your plugin JavaScript (within the temporary scope), with cordovaRef above.


##Upgrading older Cordova plugins to 1.5.0
1. Install Cordova 1.5.0
2. Replacemacrooccurrencesof"PHONEGAP_FRAMEWORK"with"CORDOVA_FRAMEWORK" 3. Replace import occurrences of "<PhoneGap/" with "<Cordova/"
4. Replace class prefixes of PG with CDV (for example PGPlugin becomes CDVPlugin)
5. Replace occurrences of [self appViewController] with self.viewController.
6. See the 1.5.0 Plugin Notes section for new functionality available to plugins

##1.6.0 Plugin Notes
1. There is a new CDVCommandDelegate protocol method available:
- (void) registerPlugin:(CDVPlugin*)plugin withClassName:(NSString*)className;
You use this in your plugin to initialize another plugin that your plugin needs to be available and running (dependency), and all plugins can access the registered plugin from the getCommandInstance method of the CDVCommandDelegate. This is a substitute for listing a plugin your plugin depends on, in Cordova.plist/Plugins.
2. There is a new IsAtLeastiOSVersion macro available in CDVAvailability.h:
// Returns YES if it is at least version specified as NSString(X) if (IsAtLeastiOSVersion(@"5.1")) {
// do something for iOS 5.1 or greater }
3. There are Compatibility headers available for versions 0.9.6 and 1.5.0, in ~/Documents/CordovaLib/Classes/compatibility (where ~ signifies your Home folder). See the "README.txt" in that folder for instructions.
Note that including these headers are all or nothing - you can't have a mix and match of plugin versions, if you include the 0.9.6 compatibility header - all your plugins must be of the same "version". It is highly recommended that you upgrade your plugins to the current version instead of using these stop-gap headers.
The 1.5.0 header shouldn't be used - this is included for the LocalStorage patch and is for using core plugins as general plugins that easily support multiple versions, and may be removed in the future.
1.5.0 Plugin Notes
1. The UIViewController returned from the viewController property will be a CDVViewController subclass.
2. The appDelegate method basically returns an (id) now, and is the same as calling [[UIApplication
sharedApplication] delegate]. In the past it returned a PhoneGapDelegate class.
3. There is a new commandDelegate property now, which gives access to the CDVCommandDelegate protocol
used by the app
4. There is a new header file CDVAvailability.h that defines Cordova versions during compile time - to check for
the current version during run-time, call [CDVViewController cordovaVersion]
