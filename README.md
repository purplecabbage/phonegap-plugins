**PLEASE NOTE**: Unless **explicitly** stated, most of these plugins will *not* work with Cordova/PhoneGap 3.x.x out of the box. They will need updating before they can be used via the `plugin add` interface.


**ALSO NOTE**: We don’t want to “clutter” this repo with code anymore. Authors should maintain the code in their own repos and just put a pointer in a README.md in this repo.

It would be best for everyone if the individual authors of the plugins were able to manage issues and pull requests while still allowing this to be an easier way for users to discover the plugins they need.

This also helps for the future whenever we decide to have a npm-like registry for Cordova plugins.

This code is completely dependent on the Apache Cordova (formerly PhoneGap) project, hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/apache)

Plugins will (for the time being) reside in this repository as pulling them into the Callback project would require all plugin contributors to meet stricter code licensing requirements pursuant to Apache's guidelines.
