## This repo has been deprecated

This repo has been deprecated and **will not be actively maintained** - no pull requests nor any other issues will be worked on. The previous source currently exists in the [**DEPRECATED branch**](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/DEPRECATED), and may be removed at a future date.

If you had a plugin in this repo, you will have to migrate it to your own repo, and create a plugin.xml file according to the [Cordova Plugin Spec](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/plugin_ref_spec.md.html), and optionally push it to the [Cordova Plugin Registry](http://plugins.cordova.io).
