Plugin Installation.
The exact manner of using a plugin in iPhone PhoneGap will likely vary with each plugin, so the following is a general rule for how to set things up to use a plugin.

A simple plugin will likely be just 3 files, generally PluginName.m, PluginName.h, and PluginName.js
The .m/.h files need to be added to your XCode project and this must be done through XCode so that XCode is aware that these files are to be compiled and linked to the application.  You can do this by manually copying the files into your project's plugins folder and from within XCode select your plugins folder, right click and choose 'Add Existing Files...' and select the files you already put in the plugins folder.

You may also choose to save a step and simply select your XCode project plugins folder, right click and choose 'Add Existing Files...' and find the files within your plugin repo, then choose copy so XCode will duplicate the files for you.

The PluginName.js is generally moved into the www folder manually and NOT a part of the XCode project. You can do this on the file-system directly by copying the file over.  Be sure to include the PluginName.js with a script tag in your html file that will interact with it, and do this AFTER including phonegap.js 

Generally you will see instructions on how to interact with the plugin, but this is up to the authors/contributors. 

Some general rules for interacting with plugins:

- do NOT call plugin methods until after the 'deviceready' event has fired.
- some plugins need to be explicitly installed. 
  ex. ChildBrowser.install();
- plugins are usually installed in the DOM at window.plugins.pluginName 
- do NOT call prototype methods, call instance methods
  ex. EmailComposer.prototype.showEmailComposer( ... 
          // WRONG, this is the definition of the method, and not the actual instance method.
  ex. window.plugins.emailComposer.showEmailComposer( ...
          // CORRECT, this is calling an instance method.
