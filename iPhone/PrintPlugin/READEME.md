# PhoneGap Print-Plugin #
by Ian Tipton (github.com/itip).

Print from iOS devices to AirPrint compatible printers. 


## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

Using this plugin requires [iPhone PhoneGap](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-iphone).

1. Make sure your PhoneGap Xcode project has been [updated for the iOS 4 SDK](http://wiki.phonegap.com/Upgrade-your-PhoneGap-Xcode-Template-for-iOS-4), and you are using PhoneGap version 1 or higher.
2. Add the .h and .m files to your Plugins folder in your project
3. Add the .js files to your "www" folder on disk, and add reference(s) to the .js files as <link> tags in your html file(s)
4. Update the PhoneGap.plist file: Find PhoneGap.plist in your project, expand the "Plugins" section, click on "+" on the last line to add a new line. Add a new value with a key of 'printPlugin' and a value of 'PrintPlugin'
5. Although printing is only supported on iOS 4.2+, if your app can be installed on earlier versions of iOS then see the 'Supporting devices running below iOS < 4.2' below.
6. See the sample index.html file for an example use of the plugin.

## RELEASE NOTES ##

### 20110813 ###
* Initial release
* Allows the printing of an HTML string to AirPrint compatible printers.


## Using the plugin ##

The plugin creates the object window.plugins.pgPrint with two methods:

### isPrintingAvailable ###

Printing is only available on devices capable of multi-tasking (iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 etc.) running iOS 4.2 or later. You can use this function to hide print functionality from users who will be unable to use it. Function takes a callback function, passed to which is a JSON object which contains a boolean property called available.

```javascript
/*
 Find out if printing is available. Use this for showing/hiding print buttons. 
 */
 window.plugins.printPlugin.isPrintingAvailable(
    function(result){
        alert(result.available ? "Printing is available" : "Printing NOT available");
    }
 );
```

### print ###
Function takes an html string and (optionally) a success callback, failure callback, and options.

1. An HTML string, e.g. <strong>hello<strong>
2. Success callback - receives an object with two parameters:
       - success (always true)
       - available (always true)
3. Failure callback - receives an object with properties
       - success (always false)
       - available (false if printing not available on this device)
       - error (error message returned by iOS in the event of an error)
4. An object which contains printing options (see below).

```javascript
//Get HTML string
var html = document.getElementById("printHTML").innerHTML;

/*
 Pass an HTML and - optionally - success function, error function.
 */
 window.plugins.printPlugin.print(
     html,
     function(result) {
        alert("Printing successful");
     }, 
     function(result) {
        if (!result.available){
           alert("Printing is not available");
        }
        else{
           //Localised error description
           alert(result.error);
        }
     }
     /*
      Add the following on an iPad to position the dialog
      ,
      {dialogOffset: {left: 500, top: 900}}
      */
 );
```

### Supporting devices running below iOS < 4.2 ###
In order to compile this for versions of iOS earlier than 4.2 (when printing was introduced) then you will need to add -weak_framework UIKit to the project settings under "Other Linker Flags". See the Stack Overflow article for more information: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4297723/ios-add-printing-but-keep-compatibility-with-ios-3.

### Testing in the iOS Simulator ###
There's no need to waste lots of paper when testing - if you're using the iOS simulator, select File->Open Printer Simulator to open some dummy printers (print outs will appear as PDF files).

### Adding Page Breaks to Printouts ###
Use the 'page-break-before' property to specify a page break, e.g.

```javascript
<p>
First page.
</p>

<p style="page-break-before: always">
Second page.
</p>
```

See W3Schools for more more information: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_print_pagebb.asp

Note: you will need to add an extra top margin to new pages.


### Printing on Real Printers ###
Printing is only supported on AirPrint-enabled printers or with the use of third-party software on your computer. The following pages contain more information:
 - AirPrint-enabled printers: http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/airprint.html
 - Enabling AirPrint on your computer: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20023976-233.html, or http://www.ecamm.com/mac/printopia/

### EXC_BAD_ACCESS in iOS Simulator ###
(Taken from the Twitter plugin).

If you have issues with the app crashing with EXC_BAD_ACCESS on iOS
Simulator you may have a weak linking issue. With your project highlighted
in the left column in XCode go to Targets > Your Project > Build Settings >
Linking > Other Linker Flags and replace -weak_library with -weak-lSystem For
