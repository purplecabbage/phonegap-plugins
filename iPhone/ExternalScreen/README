The PhoneGap iOS ExternalScreen Plugin is a native Plugin for PhoneGap/Apache Cordova which enables multi-screen application scenarios for PhoneGap projects. This plugin is only for for iOS devices.

The PhoneGap native plugin is written in Objective C, with a JavaScript interface to integrate with the client application.

The ExternalScreen plugin creates a UIWebView for the the external screen, and exposes methods for interacting with the UIWebView. Â  Note: This is just a normal UIWebView, it does not have support for all PhoneGap libraries... just a standard HTML container.

The "plugin" directory contains both the Objective-C native code, as well as the client-side javascript libraries.   To use this code, you must create PhoneGap project for iOS, copy the PGExternalScreen.h and PGExternalScreen.m files into the native code project under the "Plugins" directory.  You will need to copy the ExternalScreen.js file into the www folder for the phonegap project (or any child of that), and add references to your HTML/JS files.   You will also need to add a mapping in PhoneGap.plist for the native plugin.

The "samples" directory contains 3 sample applications:
 * Basic usage of javascript functions
 * FBI RSS Reader
 * Fleet Manager Scenario
