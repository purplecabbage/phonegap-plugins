Added Cordova 1.5 support - @RandyMcMillan 2012
Minor edits required for backwards support
In ActionSheet.js replace instances of Cordova with PhoneGap

Example:

	//PhoneGap.exec(callback, callback, service, action, [config]);
	  Cordova.exec(callback, callback, service, action, [config]);
	
Thanks to Olivier Louvignes for sharing this plugin with the PhoneGap/Cordova community!

# PhoneGap ActionSheet Plugin #
by `Olivier Louvignes`

## DESCRIPTION ##

* This plugin provides a simple way to use the `UIActionSheet` native component from IOS. It does comply with the latest (future-2.x) phonegap standards.

* Compared to the `iPhone/NativeControls` plugin, it is more documented & simpler to understand (only handle actionSheets). It does also provide new options (style).

* There is a `Sencha Touch 2.0` plugin to easily leverage this plugin [here](https://github.com/mgcrea/sencha-touch-plugins/blob/master/PhonegapActionSheet.js)

## SETUP ##

Using this plugin requires [iPhone PhoneGap](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-iphone).

1. Make sure your PhoneGap Xcode project has been [updated for the iOS 4 SDK](http://wiki.phonegap.com/Upgrade-your-PhoneGap-Xcode-Template-for-iOS-4)
2. Drag and drop the `ActionSheet` folder from Finder to your Plugins folder in XCode, using "Create groups for any added folders"
3. Add the .js files to your `www` folder on disk, and add reference(s) to the .js files as <link> tags in your html file(s)
4. Add new entry with key `ActionSheet` and value `ActionSheet` to `Plugins` in `PhoneGap.plist/Cordova.plist`

## JAVASCRIPT INTERFACE ##

    // After device ready, create a local alias
    var actionSheet = window.plugins.actionSheet;

    // Basic with title
    actionSheet.create('Title', ['Foo', 'Bar'], function(buttonValue, buttonIndex) { console.warn('create', [this, arguments]); });

    // Complex
    actionSheet.create(null, ['Add', 'Delete', 'Cancel'], function(buttonValue, buttonIndex) { console.warn('create', [this, arguments]); }, {destructiveButtonIndex: 1, cancelButtonIndex: 2});

* Check [source](http://github.com/mgcrea/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone/ActionSheet/ActionSheet.js) for additional configuration.

## BUGS AND CONTRIBUTIONS ##

Patches welcome! Send a pull request. Since this is not a part of PhoneGap Core (which requires a CLA), this should be easier.
