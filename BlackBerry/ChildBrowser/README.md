# ChildBrowser plugin for Cordova #

The child browser allows you to display external web pages within your Cordova application in either a custom browser field or in the device's builtin browser.  Web pages accessed through the child browser plugin are not restricted by the whitelist entries in the applications config.xml.

The custom browser view provides advantages over the builtin browser.  The custom browser provides the ability to be notified of URL location changes and when the browser is closed.  Additionally, with the custom browser it is possible to have a chrome-less view or a view with a navigation bar at the top.

Whether the custom browser or builtin browser is used the user is always brought back to the original application when the user backs out or closes the browser.

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

Using this plugin requires [Cordova BlackBerry-WebWorks](http://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-blackberry-webworks).

1. To install the plugin, move www/childbrowser.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html file after cordova.js.

    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="childbrowser.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

2. Copy the image files folder www/childbrowser to your project's www folder. Note, you need the entire folder not just the images.

3. Add the plugin source to your cordova.jar in your projects ext folder.  The cordova.jar file is a jar of source code.  Open cordova.jar with your favorite archive manager or use the jar command to create a directory called "org/apache/cordova/plugins/childbrowser" and copy the `.java` files into it.

4. In your projects plugins.xml file add the following line:

    &lt;plugin name="ChildBrowser" value="org.apache.cordova.plugins.childbrowser.ChildBrowser"/&gt;

## Using the plugin ##

The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.childBrowser`.  To use, call one of the following, available methods:

### Load a URL in a custom browser ###

    showWebPage(url, [options])
        Where:
            url:     The URL to load
            options: An object that specifies additional options.

The following values are recognized for the `options` parameter.

* showLocationBar - boolean value indicating whether to show a navigation bar or not. The location bar provides UI elements for back, forward, stop/refresh and URL entry.

Sample use:

    window.plugins.childBrowser.showWebPage("http://www.google.com", { showLocationBar: true });

### Close an open custom browser ###

    close()

Sample use:

    window.plugins.childBrowser.close();

### Receive notification that the custom browser closed ###

    onClose()

Sample use:

    function closed() {
        console.log("The browser window was closed");
    }
    window.plugins.childBrowser.onClose = closed;

### Receive notification when the browser location changes ###

    onLocationChange(location)

Sample use:

    function locationChanged(newurl) {
        console.log("Location was changed to: " + newurl);
    }
    window.plugins.childBrowser.onLocationChange = locationChanged;

### Receive notification when an error occurs in the custom browser ###

    onError(data)

Sample use:

    function error(msg) {
        console.log("An error occurred while browsing: " + msg);
    }
    window.plugins.childBrowser.onError = error;

### Load a URL in the device's builtin browser ###

    openExternal(url, [useCordova])
        Where:
            url:         The URL to load
            useCordova: Ignored. Maintained for API consistency with Android

Sample use:

    window.plugins.childBrowser.openExternal("http://www.google.com");

## Known Issues ##

* Severe rendering issue appearing in landscape mode on Torch 9800 running OS 6. Looks like only portrait resolution is being rendered and the rest is clipped. Issue does not appear in simulators.  Not sure at this time if it happens on other devices.
* On OS 5 non-touchscreen devices, the navigation bar does not acquire focus when the pointer is within the navigation bar region.  This is a known issue on OS 5 with BrowserField elements.  On OS 5, once the BrowserField acquires focus it does not release focus to other UI elements like it should.  To move focus to the navigation bar, the user must click the trackpad/roller in the navigation bar region.  The user will then be able to focus the individual UI elements.
* When editing the URL in the navigation bar the full URL is not always shown. For some reason it appears that the text box is wrapping text.
