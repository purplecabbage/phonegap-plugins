# TTS plugin for Phonegap #

The TTS class that allows you to access the devices TTS services.

A simple use case would be:

- Playing text passed into the service out as synthesized speech

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

Using this plugin requires [Android PhoneGap](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-android).

1. To install the plugin, move www/tts.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html file after phonegap.{ver}.js.

    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="phonegap.{ver}.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="tts.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

2. Create a directory within your project called "src/com/phonegap/plugins/speech" and copy src/com/phonegap/plugins/speech/TTS.java into it.

3. Add the following activity to your AndroidManifest.xml file.  It should be added inside the &lt;application&gt; tag.

    &lt;activity android:name="com.phonegap.DroidGap" android:label="@string/app_name"&gt;<br/>
      &lt;intent-filter&gt;<br/>
      &lt;/intent-filter&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/activity&gt;

## Using the plugin ##

The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.tts`.  To use, call one of the following, available methods:

<pre>
/**
 * Play the passed in text as synthasized speech
 * 
 * @param {DOMString} text
 * @param {Object} successCallback
 * @param {Object} errorCallback
 */
</pre>
speak(text, successCallback, errorCallback);

Sample use:

    window.plugins.tts.speak("The TTS service is ready", win, fail);

<pre>
/** 
 * Play silence for the number of ms passed in as duration
 * 
 * @param {long} duration
 * @param {Object} successCallback
 * @param {Object} errorCallback
 */
</pre>
silence(duration, successCallback, errorCallback);

Sample use:

    window.plugins.tts.silence(2000, win, fail);

<pre>
/**
 * Starts up the TTS Service
 * 
 * @param {Object} successCallback
 * @param {Object} errorCallback
 */
</pre>
startup(successCallback, errorCallback);

Sample use:

    window.plugins.tts.startup(win, fail);

<pre>
/**
 * Shuts down the TTS Service if you no longer need it.
 * 
 * @param {Object} successCallback
 * @param {Object} errorCallback
 */
</pre>
shutdown(successCallback, errorCallback);

Sample use:

    window.plugins.tts.shutdown(win, fail);

<pre>
/**
 * Finds out if the language is currently supported by the TTS service.
 * 
 * @param {DOMSting} lang
 * @param {Object} successCallback
 * @param {Object} errorCallback
 */
</pre>
isLanguageAvailable(lang, successCallback, errorCallback);

Sample use:

    window.plugins.tts.isLanguageAvailable(lang, win, fail);

<pre>
/**
 * Finds out the current language of the TTS service.
 * 
 * @param {Object} successCallback
 * @param {Object} errorCallback
 */
</pre>
getLanguage(successCallback, errorCallback);

Sample use:

    window.plugins.tts.getLanguage(win, fail);

<pre>
/**
 * Sets the language of the TTS service.
 * 
 * @param {DOMString} lang
 * @param {Object} successCallback
 * @param {Object} errorCallback
 */
</pre>
setLanguage(lang, successCallback, errorCallback);

Sample use:

    window.plugins.tts.setLanguage(lang, win, fail);
