# WebIntents plugin for Phonegap #
By Boris Smus

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##
1. To install the plugin, move webintent.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html files. 
2. Create a folder called "borismus" within your project's src/com/ folder and move the java file into it.

## Using the plugin ##
The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.webintent` with five methods:

### startActivity ###
Launches an Android intent. For example:


    window.plugins.webintent.startActivity({
        action: WebIntent.ACTION_VIEW,
        url: 'geo:0,0?q=' + address}, 
        function() {}, 
        function() {alert('Failed to open URL via Android Intent')};
    );


### hasExtra ###
checks if this app was invoked with the specified extra. For example:

    window.plugins.webintent.hasExtra(WebIntent.EXTRA_TEXT, 
        function(has) {
            // has is true iff it has the extra
        }, function() {
            // Something really bad happened.
        }
    );
 
### getExtra ###
Gets the extra that this app was invoked with. For example:

    window.plugins.webintent.getExtra(WebIntent.EXTRA_TEXT, 
        function(url) {
            // url is the value of EXTRA_TEXT
        }, function() {
            // There was no extra supplied.
        }
    );

### getUri ###
Gets the Uri the app was invoked with. For example:

    window.plugins.webintent.getUri(function(url) {
        if(url !== "") {
            // url is the url the intent was launched with
        }
    });

### onNewIntent ###
Gets called when onNewIntent is called for the parent activity. Used in only certain launchModes. For example:

    window.plugins.webintent.onNewIntent(function(url) {
        if(url !== "") {
            // url is the url that was passed to onNewIntent
        }
    });
