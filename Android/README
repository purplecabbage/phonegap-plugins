**PLEASE NOTE**: Unless **explicitly** stated, most of these plugins will *not* work with Cordova/PhoneGap 3.x.x out of the box. They will need updating before they can be used via the `plugin add` interface.

This code is completely dependent on the PhoneGap project, also hosted on
GitHub ( github.com/phonegap/phonegap )

This folder is for Android specific plugins.
Please include a readme in your plugin, and preferably some sample code for how to use it.
Please specify what devices+os versions your plugin supports.
