# ClipboardManager plugin for Phonegap #
By Omer Saatcioglu

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##
1. To install the plugin, move clipboardmanager.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html files. 
2. Create a folder called 'src/com/saatcioglu/phonegap/clipboardmanager' within your project's src folder.
3. And copy ClipboardManagerPlugin.java into that new folder.

`mkdir <your_project>/src/com/saatcioglu/phonegap/clipboardmanager`
`cp ./ClipboardManagerPlugin.java <your_project>/src/com/beetight/barcodescanner`

## Using the plugin ##
The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.clipboardManager` with the methods 

`copy(str, success, fail)` that copies the given string
`paste(success, fail)` that returns the text from the Clipboard

`success` and `fail` are callback functions. 

An example for copy:

	window.plugins.clipboardManager.copy(
		"the text to copy",
		function(r){alert("copy is successful")},
		function(e){alert(e)}
	);

An example for paste:

	window.plugins.clipboardManager.paste(
		function(r){alert("The text in the clipboard is " + r)},
		function(e){alert(e)}
	);
