# Barcode Scanner plugin for Phonegap #
By Matt Kane

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##
This plugin requires the end user to install [the ZXing Barcode Scanner app](http://code.google.com/p/zxing/)
If the user doesn't have the app install they will be promped to install it the first time the plugin is used.

1. To install the plugin, move barcodescanner.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it 
in your html files. 
2. Create a folder called 'src/com/beetight/barcodescanner' within your project's src/com/ folder.
3. And copy the java file into that new folder.

`mkdir <your_project>/src/com/beetight/barcodescanner`

`cp ./BarcodeScanner.java <your_project>/src/com/beetight/barcodescanner`

## Using the plugin ##
The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.barcodeScanner` with one method `scan(types, success, fail, options)`
`types` is a comma-separated list of barcode types that the scanner should accept. If you pass null then any
barcode type will be accepted. The following types are currently available:

* QR_CODE
* DATA_MATRIX
* UPC_E
* UPC_A
* EAN_8
* EAN_13
* CODE_128
* CODE_39
* CODE_93
* CODABAR
* ITF
* RSS14
* PDF417
* RSS_EXPANDED

Take a look in the javascript file for the list, as well as some convenience constants.

`success` and `fail` are callback functions. Success is passed the decoded barcode as a string. `options` allows
you to change the strings used in the dialog box which is displayed if the user doesn't have Barcode Scanner 
installed. The defaults are:

    {
        installTitle = "Install Barcode Scanner?",
        installMessage = "This requires the free Barcode Scanner app. Would you like to install it now?",
        yesString = "Yes",
        noString = "No"
    }

A full example could be:

    window.plugins.barcodeScanner.scan( BarcodeScanner.Type.QR_CODE, function(result) {
            alert("We got a barcode: " + result);
        }, function(error) {
		    alert("Scanning failed: " + error);
	    }, {yesString: "Install"}
	);

## Encoding a Barcode ##
Supported encoding types:

* TEXT_TYPE
* EMAIL_TYPE
* PHONE_TYPE
* SMS_TYPE


A full example could be:

            window.plugins.barcodeScanner.encode(BarcodeScanner.Encode.TEXT_TYPE, "http://www.nytimes.com", function(success) {
  	        alert("encode success: " + success);
  	      }, function(fail) {
  	        alert("encoding failed: " + fail);
  	      }, {yesString: "Install"}
  	    );
